## 👩🏽‍💻 **Setup and Installation**
Follow these steps to run the project in **Google Colab** and reproduce the results.

* Open the Colab notebook [KPMG_1F_AI_ENERGY_Analsysis.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/abbyh1/AI-Energy-Prediction/blob/main/KPMG_1F_AI_ENERGY_Analsysis.ipynb)

2. Click **“File → Save a copy in Drive”** to make your own editable copy.

3. Follow the notebook instructions and run the cells **top to bottom**.

The notebook installs all required dependencies, loads the dataset, performs EDA, trains the models, and evaluates results automatically.
